# MNIST_Handwritten_digits_classification_Project
This project demonstrates building a neural network to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The goal is to create a model that can accurately recognize digits (0â€“9) in images, and explore the impact of different architectures and hyperparameters on performance.
